        <p>
            I'm glad you've decided to get to know more about me. I started creating this website in May of 2024 
            after getting started with <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project (TOP)</a>. TOP is a open source project that teaches you the basics
            of web development and takes you down a long but rewarding path to become a web developer. If you landed on this page in recent time from my creating it
            then it will look like a basic website that anyone can find back in the early 2000's. However, as I learn more and progress through out this web developer journey 
            I'll be customizing my website more.
