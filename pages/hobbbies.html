    <p>
        Outside of my school work and coding I enjoy doing photography and playing competitive Valorant.
        Valorant is a video game. I'm currently participating in my universities D1 esports team which I 
        have been part of since the fall of 2022 when it was first declared that CSU would have
        an esports team.
